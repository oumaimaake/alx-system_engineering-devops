### <div align="center"> Outage Postmortem: The Great Emoji Outage of 2023! </div>

## Issue Summary:

- **Duration:**
- Start Time: January 15, 2023, 14:30 UTC
- End Time: January 15, 2023, 18:45 UTC

- **Impact:**
The repercussions of The Great Emoji Outage of 2023 were profound and felt across our user community. With the emoji service completely unavailable for approximately 4 hours, chaos ensued in the digital expression landscape. An estimated 85% of users were affected, accustomed to the vibrant and varied language of emojis, found themselves stripped of this universal form of communication.

**Root Cause:**
   - An unintentional global replacement of the emoji database with ASCII art depicting cats wearing space helmets.

##  Timeline:

- **14:30 UTC: Issue Detected**
   - An influx of user complaints via customer support and social media.
   - Monitoring alerts triggered due to a sudden spike in failed emoji requests.

- **14:45 UTC: Initial Investigation**
   - Assumed a possible server overload due to increased user activity.
   - Investigated server logs for performance bottlenecks.

- **15:30 UTC: Misleading Paths**
   - Engaged security team for a comprehensive security audit.

- **16:15 UTC: Escalation**
   - Escalated the incident to the emoji engineering team.
   - Shared findings and assumptions to collaborate on identifying the root cause.

- **17:00 UTC: Realization**
   - Discovered the accidental replacement of the emoji database during routine maintenance.
   - Recognized the global distribution of ASCII cat emojis as the root cause.

- **18:45 UTC: Resolution**
   - Rolled back the database to the last known good state.
   - Implemented additional safeguards to prevent accidental database replacements.

## Root Cause and Resolution

- **Root Cause:**
   - During a routine maintenance script, a developer inadvertently modified the script's target database. Instead of updating the intended emoji database, the script erroneously pointed to the ASCII cat emoji database. This unintended redirection went unnoticed during the pre-deployment review.

- **Resolution:**
   - Rolled back the database to the state before the unintended replacement.
   - Implemented stricter access controls for database maintenance scripts.
   - Added a confirmation step with human-readable prompts to prevent similar mishaps.

## Corrective and Preventative Measures

- **Improvements/Fixes:**
   - Enhance monitoring for critical services and set up alerts for unusual database modifications.
   - Conduct regular training sessions on proper maintenance procedures for the engineering team.

- **Tasks to Address the Issue:**
   - Implement a staging environment for testing maintenance scripts before production deployment.
   - Develop and implement a system for versioning and tracking changes to critical databases.
   - Improve communication channels for incident escalation to ensure faster response times.
